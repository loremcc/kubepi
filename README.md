### ðŸ§± Deployment Plan

> **Objective:**  
> Deploy a Raspberry Pi 5 (8 GB) as a high-privacy, self-contained network gateway that anonymizes, encrypts, and manages all traffic inside your LAN.  
> The Pi hides client identities, controls bandwidth, and switches between Normal, Privacy, and Anonymity modes via a YubiKey.
